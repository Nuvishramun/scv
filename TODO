Next minor edition:
* The text on the printed cover needs updating, it's minor but see
  https://github.com/jirilebl/scv/commit/18438d398643f05019fd143443ef8ec858bf4ae2

Next larger edition
* Add appendix on basic notation, smooth functions, etc... perhaps
* Add appendix differential forms and integration including Stokes,
  no need to prove Stokes I don't think, but at least state it.
* Add appendix with the basic one-variable theorems used
* Add notation index
