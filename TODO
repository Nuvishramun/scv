Next minor edition:
* 

Next larger edition
* Add appendix on basic notation, smooth functions, etc... perhaps
* Add appendix differential forms and integration including Stokes,
  no need to prove Stokes I don't think, but at least state it.
* Add appendix with the basic one-variable theorems used
* Add notation index
* Maybe rewrite the one-variable section to be more formal and do that
  instead of the appendix above?  Perhaps move the proof of Cauchy-Pompeiu
  here?
