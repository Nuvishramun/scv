* A good exercise early on could be hartogs for a single missing point and a
  bounded function.  Or perhaps a more general set that hits direction only in
  isolated points.  That's an immediate application of one-var Riemann
  extension and our definition of holomorphic.

* Perhaps another short appendix on the real analysis stuff that is needed.
  Differentiation under the integral, taking limits under the integral, taking
  limits past sums, perhaps a quick definition for lebesgue integral and the
  convergence theorems.  No more than a couple of pages should be needed.

* Perhaps shorten "line length" by making margins larger and using a font
  like newpx (Palatino) for better readability.  Right now it is at around
  100cpl, which is too long, want to shoot for 80 or so.
