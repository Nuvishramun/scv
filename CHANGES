* New slightly different font
* Slightly more general Cauchy-Pompeiu
* Add Re/Im notation in 0.1
* Make difference quotient in 0.1 look like the one in 1.1 for consistency.
* Add $C^k$ and $C^\infty$ and smooth in 0.1 since its needed all over.
* Include "minimum principle" in the max principle for harmonic functions in 0.1
* Add a bit more algebra detail and make sure to point out the rings are commutative
* Move all the $O(\ell)$ explanation into one place
* Clarifications and rewordings throughout
* Add picture of unit ball in two dimensions
* Equations renumbered in chapter 1
* Add note on integrability in 1.1
* Add exercise 1.1.5
* Add exercise 1.2.17
** Add two exercises in 1.4, which renumbers the other exercises.
* Add definition of Levi-flat to end of 2.3 and add exercises 2.3.13-2.3.17
** Move the solution of Dirichlet problem up in 2.4 so that it can be used.  This renumbers the exercises in 2.4
* Add figure to proof of Cauchy-Pompeiu
* Add explanation of why simply connectedness is important for global definition of roots after Proposition 6.2.6
* Add note (and exercise) on well-definedness of dimension, and some rewording in 6.4.
** Add three exercises in 6.4 renumbering all exercises in 6.4 after 6.4.4
* Add a very short Appendix A on basic notation, which may not be totally standard
* Add Appendix B on one complex variable stuff
* Add Appendix C on differential forms and Stokes' theorem
