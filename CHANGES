Since 3.2

* An extra example of the density of regular points after 1.6.2
* State Exercise 2.3.13 in a simpler way asking for the function to just 
  be holomorphic in $W$.  It is asking for something slightly stronger, but      
  that is the way to really solve it anyway, and it should be easier this way
* Add hint to Exercise 2.4.7, it was probably a tiny bit too hard if we do
  not have all the harmonic function machinery.
* Improve wording of Exercise 6.8.3 to be more precise.
* Rewrite bits of the basic notations appendix.
* In the definition of $C^1$ path assume that derivative is nonzero.
* More reasonable wording of the argument principle.
* Several minor clarifications.
* A bunch of other minor improvements in language and grammar.
* Fix the errata.
