* New slightly different font
* A bunch of places used "domain" where "open set" is just as good.
* Slightly more general Cauchy-Pompeiu
* Add Re/Im notation in 0.1
* Make difference quotient in 0.1 look like the one in 1.1 for consistency.
* Add $C^k$ and $C^\infty$ and smooth in 0.1 since its needed all over.
* Include "minimum principle" in the max principle for harmonic functions in 0.1
* Add a bit more algebra detail and make sure to point out the rings are commutative
* Move all the $O(\ell)$ explanation into one place
* Add a note (and a footnote) about the more standard big-oh notation vs our shorthand
* Clarifications and rewordings throughout
* Add picture of unit ball in two dimensions
* Equations renumbered in chapter 1
* Add note on integrability in 1.1
* Add note on partial z derivative being the limit of difference quotients
** Add three exercises in 1.1, but that renumbers the last exercise
* Add more on the multiindex notation as it is used to hopefully make the computations less mysterious, also add more details on the convergence.
* Use the "reduce to one variable proof" as the main one for converse of the power series theorem, and add one more alternative proof with an exercise
** Make the Cauchy estimates and computation of coefficients into a proposition, which renumbers the propositions/theorems/etc.. in 1.2
* The proposition about normal convergence only needs an open set, not a domain
** Add two exercises in 1.2, which renumbers the other exercises.  (??? and 1.2.18)
* Say "local maximum" for the maximum principle ... why not.
* Makes more sense to define complete Reinhardt domains with closed polydiscs, so do that
** In 1.3, move the implicit function theorem to the end of the section (past chain rule for mappings and the proposition on the determinant of the Jacobian), it is much more natural to prove it then.  So the last three results and last three exercises in the section are renumbered.
** Add two exercises in 1.4, which renumbers the other exercises.
* Add definition of Levi-flat to end of 2.3 and add exercises 2.3.13-2.3.17
** Move the solution of Dirichlet problem up in 2.4 so that it can be used.  This renumbers the exercises in 2.4
* Add figure to proof of Cauchy-Pompeiu
* Add explanation of why simply connectedness is important for global definition of roots after Proposition 6.2.6
* Add note (and exercise) on well-definedness of dimension, and some rewording in 6.4.
** Add three exercises in 6.4 renumbering all exercises in 6.4 after 6.4.4
* Add a very short Appendix A on basic notation, which may not be totally standard
* Add Appendix B on one complex variable stuff
* Add Appendix C on differential forms and Stokes' theorem
* Add list of notations
