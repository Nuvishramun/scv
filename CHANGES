Since 3.2

* State Exercise 2.3.13 in a simpler way asking for the function to just 
  be holomorphic in $W$.  It is asking for something slightly stronger, but      
  that is the way to really solve it anyway, and it should be easier this way
* Add hint to Exercise 2.4.7, it was probably a tiny bit too hard if we do
  not have all the harmonic function machinery.
* A bunch of improvements in language and grammar.
