Since 3.1

* Fix errata
* Minor improvements in wording, style, and grammar.
* Move exercise 2.2.5 just past example 2.2.7 since that makes a bit more sense
  (no numbers were changed, but it appears one page later).
* In Exercise 5.2.6, let U be either the unit ball or the unit polydisc.  The
  original was way too hard and didn't immediately apply to help with 5.2.8
* Add the statement of completeness of the Bergman space into Lemma 5.2.1
  as that makes more sense, and essentially it just moves where the QED symbol
  appears.
* Use "zero" consistently instead of mixing "zero" and "root" in chapter 6
