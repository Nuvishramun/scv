The main goals of this revision are several-fold:
1) Fill in some more of the details/examples/figures to make the course more
accessible with just a basic knowledge of undergraduate reals and vector
calculus and a one-complex variable course, especially in chapters 1-4.
This was the goal before, but there were gaps in this goal.
2) Add appendices on basic theorems in one complex variable and on Stokes
theorem and differential forms (without proofs)
3) Do some minor reordering to make the flow a bit more logical, reword some
theorems/lemmas/propositions, and make some results that were just mentioned
in text or exercises into proper propositions.
4) Fix any issues found along the way, and simplify a few proofs.
5) Add a few exercises and one or two concepts, but really, there's not much
new material in this edition, mostly just more motivation for what we are
doing, and hopefully clearer (and cleaner) exposition.

These are only the somewhat larger changes.  Lots of small minor
improvements have been made throughout.

* New slightly different font
* A bunch of places used "domain" where "open set" is just as good.
* Slightly more general Cauchy-Pompeiu
* Add Re/Im notation in 0.1
* Make difference quotient in 0.1 look like the one in 1.1 for consistency.
* Add $C^k$ and $C^\infty$ and smooth in 0.1 since its needed all over.
* Include "minimum principle" in the max principle for harmonic functions in 0.1
* Add a bit more algebra detail and make sure to point out the rings are
  commutative
* Move all the $O(\ell)$ explanation into one place
* Add a note (and a footnote) about the more standard big-oh notation vs our
  shorthand
* Clarifications and rewordings throughout
* Add picture of unit ball in two dimensions
* Equations renumbered in chapter 1
* Add note on integrability in 1.1
* Add note on partial z derivative being the limit of difference quotients
** Add three exercises in 1.1, but that renumbers the last exercise
* Add more on the multiindex notation as it is used to hopefully make the
  computations less mysterious, also add more details on the convergence.
* Use the "reduce to one variable proof" as the main one for converse of the
  power series theorem, and add one more alternative proof with an exercise
** Make the Cauchy estimates and computation of coefficients into a
   proposition, which renumbers the propositions/theorems/etc.. in 1.2
* The proposition about normal convergence only needs an open set, not a domain
** Add two exercises in 1.2, which renumbers the other exercises.  (??? and
   1.2.18)
* Say "local maximum" for the maximum principle ... why not.
* Makes more sense to define complete Reinhardt domains with closed
  polydiscs, so do that
** In 1.3, move the implicit function theorem to the end of the section
   (past chain rule for mappings and the proposition on the determinant of the
   Jacobian), it is much more natural to prove it then.  So the last three
   results and last three exercises in the section are renumbered.
** Add a couple of exercises in 1.3
* Add figure to proof of Rothstein's theorem in 1.4
** Add exercises in 1.4, which renumbers the other exercises.
* Add a little bit of explanation of the computation for $f^\ell$ in 1.5
* Add an exercise to 1.5
* Add examples for analytic sets in 1.6.
* Avoid unnecessary use of Sard's theorem in the theorem "one-to-one implies
  biholomorphic" (was 1.6.3)
* Add a short blurb about convexity right at the beginning of 2.1
* Improve figure for Hartogs figure.
* Add exercises to 2.1
** Add part b) to exercise 2.2.2 for any function vanishing on $M$ 
* Add a blurb about tangent space being derivatives along $M$ and give a
  short example, this renumbers the rest of the definitions/lemmas
* Split up the numbered definitions in 2.2 a bit more.
* Add a bit more clarification to how this relates to standard vector calculus
* Add proposition for the "inertia of Levi form" does not depend on the
  defining function and exercise 2.3.3 now just says to prove this
  proposition.
* Similarly, add the "inertia is preserved" to the change of variables
  theorem (was 2.3.7) right after instead of just making it a remark after
  the theorem
* Add discussion in 2.3 of the Levi form in terms of graph coordinates
  before the Lewy hypersurface example
* Add figure of the Lewy hypersurface
* Simplify the lemma normalizing the Levi form.  There is really no reason
  for the derivatives.
** Add 2 exercises to 2.3 towards the end, renumbering exercises.
* Add definition of Levi-flat to end of 2.3 and add 5 related exercises
* Computation of the complex Hessian under change of coordinates is done
  with different variable names on source and target for more clarity
* Add graph of Poisson kernel for a few $r$
* Add a picture for $n=1$ for definition of subharmonic function where it is
  just the convex function 
* Make the problem with looking for the (weakly/strongly) pseudoconvex
  points more logical, and include 3 different domains
** Move the solution of Dirichlet problem up in 2.4 so that it can be used.
  This renumbers the exercises in 2.4
* Add a remark about how pluriharmonic and plurisubharmonic functions are
  in some sense the correct several complex variable generalizations of
  affine linear and convex functions.
* Rework and add exercises in 2.4
* Clarify/simplify the proof of Rado's theorem and add a figure.
* Add a note about convexity and example of the hull in section 2.5.
** Add exercises in 2.5, renumbering the other exercises
* Rename chapter 3 to "CR functions" from "CR geometry" since we really did
  quite a bit of "CR geometry" in chapter 2 already, in chapter 3 it is
  CR functions specifically that we are interested in.
** Rework and add exercises in 2.6 which renumbers them
* State the solution of the Levi problem as a theorem in 2.6 even though we
  do not prove it.
* Add definition of logarithmically convex complete Reinhardt domain and
  a series of exercises that prove the Levi problem for complete Reinhardt
  domains after Cartan-Thullen
** Add a few exercises in 3.1 renumbering the rest
* In 3.2 add the "reality condition" the complexified graph proposition, and
  with it fix the gap showing that the vector fields given give the CR
  vector fields
* In the complexified graph proposition, define complexification of $M$
  and also state that functions vanishing on $M$ vanish on the
  complexification, which is left as an exercise.
* Add a short example of the complexified graph result.
** Add a couple of exercises in 3.2, renumbering others
* In 3.2, prove the proposition "zero on the boundary means zero inside"
  including in one dimension (using Rado), and add a figure.
* Add an exercise in 3.4
* Add figure to proof of Cauchy-Pompeiu
* Add figure for Weierstrass preparation theorem
* Add more complete explanation of what symmetric functions are
* Add explanation of why simply connectedness is important for global
  definition of roots after Proposition 6.2.6
* Add a couple of simple examples in 6.4.
* Add note (and exercise) on well-definedness of dimension, and some
  rewording in 6.4.
** Add three exercises in 6.4 renumbering all exercises in 6.4 after 6.4.4
* Add a very short Appendix A on basic notation, which may not be totally standard
* Add Appendix B on one complex variable stuff
* Add Appendix C on differential forms and Stokes' theorem
* Add list of notations
