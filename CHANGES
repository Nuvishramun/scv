Since 3.1

* Fix errata
* A couple of minor improvements in wording
* In Exercise 5.2.6, let U be either the unit ball or the unit polydisc.  The
  original was way too hard and didn't immediately apply to help with 5.2.8
* Move exercise 2.2.5 just past example 2.2.7 since that makes a bit more sense
  (no numbers were changed, but it appears one page later).
