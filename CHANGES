The main goals of this revision are several-fold:

<ul>
<li>Fill in some more of the details to make the course more
accessible.
<li>Add more figures where appropriate.
<li>Add more examples throughout.
<li>Reorganize some of the more confusing sections, to make the flow more logical.
<li>Reword some of the results.
<li>Add many exercises.
<li>Make some results that were just mentioned
in text or exercises into proper propositions/theorems.
<li>Fix any issues found along the way, and simplify a few proofs.
<li>Add one or two concepts (Levi-flat and solution of the Levi
problem for Reinhardt domains), but really, there's not much new material in
this edition, mostly just more motivation for what we are doing, and hopefully
clearer (and cleaner) exposition.
<li>Add appendices on basic theorems in one complex variable, on Stokes
theorem and differential forms (without proofs), and algebra.
</ul>

These are only the somewhat larger changes.  Lots of small minor
improvements have been made throughout.

<ul>
<li>New slightly different font
<li><b>Theorems, exercises, and even some sections have been renumbered due to
some of the reordering, the new material, and the new exercises.</b>  This was
unavoidable.
<li>A bunch of places used "domain" where "open set" is just as good.  So try to use domain
only when connectedness is needed.
<li>Slightly more general Cauchy-Pompeiu
<li>Add Re/Im notation in 0.1
<li>Make difference quotient in 0.1 look like the one in 1.1 for consistency.
<li>Add definition $C^k$ and $C^\infty$ and smooth in 0.1 since its needed all over.
<li>Include "minimum principle" in the max principle for harmonic functions in 0.1
<li>Add a bit more algebra detail and make sure to point out the rings are
  commutative.
<li>Move all the $O(\ell)$ explanation into one place, and explain the difference
between the more standard big-oh notation vs our shorthand
<li>Add picture of unit ball in two dimensions
<li>Fill in some more details in 1.1.
<li>Add exercises in 1.1.
<li>Add more on the multiindex notation as it is used to hopefully make the
  computations less mysterious.

  power series theorem, and add one more alternative proof with an exercise
<li>Make the Cauchy estimates and computation of coefficients into a
   proposition in 1.2
<li>Add exercises in 1.2
<li>Say "local maximum" for the maximum principle ... why not.
<li>Makes more sense to define complete Reinhardt domains with closed
  polydiscs, so do that
<li>In 1.3, move the implicit function theorem to the end of the section
   (past chain rule for mappings and the proposition on the determinant of the
   Jacobian), it is much more natural to prove it then.
<li>Add exercises in 1.3
<li>Add figure to proof of Rothstein's theorem in 1.4
<li>Add exercises in 1.4
<li>Add a little bit of explanation of the computation for $f^\ell$ in 1.5
<li>Add an exercise to 1.5
<li>Add examples for analytic sets in 1.6.
<li>Avoid unnecessary use of Sard's theorem in the theorem "one-to-one implies
  biholomorphic" (was 1.6.3)

<li>Add a blurb about tangent space being derivatives along $M$ and give a
  short example
<li>Split up the numbered definitions in 2.2 a bit more.
<li>Add proposition for the "inertia of Levi form" does not depend on the
  defining function and relevant exercise now just says to prove this
  proposition.
<li>Similarly, add the "inertia is preserved" to the change of variables
  theorem (was 2.3.7) instead of just making it a remark after
  the theorem
<li>Add discussion in 2.3 of the Levi form in terms of graph coordinates
  before the Lewy hypersurface example
<li>Add figure of the Lewy hypersurface

  for the derivatives.

<li>Add definition of Levi-flat to end of 2.3 and add related exercises
<li>Computation of the complex Hessian under change of coordinates is done
  with different variable names on source and target for more clarity
<li>Add graph of Poisson kernel for a few $r$
<li>Add a figure for $n=1$ for definition of subharmonic function where it is
  just the convex function 
<li>Make the exercise about the (weakly/strongly) pseudoconvex
  points more logical, and include 3 different domains
<li>Move the solution of Dirichlet problem up in 2.4 so that it can be used.

<li>Add definition of logarithmically convex complete Reinhardt domain and
  a series of exercises that prove the Levi problem for complete Reinhardt
  domains after Cartan-Thullen
<li>Rename chapter 3 to "CR functions" from "CR geometry" since we really did
  quite a bit of "CR geometry" in chapter 2 already, in chapter 3 it is
  CR functions specifically that we are interested in.
<li>Add exercises in 3.1 
<li>Add a bit more explanation of the complexification and the abuse of notation
  for treating $\bar{z}$ as an independent variable in the context of
  real-analytic functions.
<li>In 3.2, explain taking derivatives of functions only defined on a
  hypersurface, and add a relevant exercise.
<li>In the proposition that a restriction of a holomorphic function is a
  smooth CR function, use the directly definition, it is easier.

  with it fix the gap showing that the vector fields given give the CR
  vector fields
<li>In the complexified graph proposition, define complexification of $M$
  and also state that functions vanishing on $M$ vanish on the
  complexification, which is left as an exercise.
